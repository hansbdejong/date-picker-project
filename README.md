# date-picker-project

I built a date picker using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I did not use any libraries for this project. Instead, I wrote a JavaScript DatePicker class that directly manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) and adds event listeners on DOM elements. I also used the JavaScript Date object to calculate the day of the week for the first day of a specified month-year, as well as the number of days in that month-year.

The number of rows is not fixed (while most months have 5 weeks, some have 4 or 6 weeks) and some weeks contain days from a different month, which are showed in a dimmed fashion. The date picker also contains controls to change the calendarâ€™s display to the previous or next month.
